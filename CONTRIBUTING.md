# Contributing to _sharedwisdom_
We appreciate your contributions to expand our collection of learning resources! Please follow these simple steps when contributing:

## Contribution Guidelines
1. **Submit Resources, Not Websites**: Only contribute resources like PDFs or videos by providing links to cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
   **Do not** provide links to websites. This ensures the content remains consistent, as the resources behind these links will not change,
   unlike websites which may update or modify their content.

2. **Open a New Issue**: To contribute, open a new issue with the label **'new resource'**. Please use the following schema when submitting your resource:
   ```json
   "<resource-name>": {
       "description": "<resource-description>",
       "links": {
           "Lecture Notes": "<cloud-storage-link>"
       },
       "courtesy": {
           "Lecture Notes": "<social-media-profile-link>"
       }
   }
   ```
   > Replace the placeholders with the relevant details of the resource you're contributing. This helps us organize and add it efficiently.

3. **Mention the Authors**: Please **do not forget to mention the authors** of the resource in the "courtesy" section.
   We take courtesy seriously and want to give proper credit to the original creators of the resources.
