# Contributing

<i>We appreciate your contributions to expand our collection of learning resources!</i>

## Contributin Guidelines

1. `Submit Resources, Not Websites`: Only contribute resources like PDFs or videos by providing links to cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox). Do not provide links to websites. This ensures the content remains consistent, as the resources behind these links will not change, unlike websites which may update or modify their content.

2. `Open a New Issue`: To contribute, open a new issue using the 'New resource template'.
	>  Replace the placeholders with the relevant details of the resource you're contributing. This helps us organize and add it efficiently.

3. `Mention the Authors`: Please do not forget to mention the authors of the resource in the "courtesy" section. We take courtesy seriously and want to give proper credit to the original authors of the resources.
